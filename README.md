```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NUWORKS_COOKIE="your_nuworks_cookie_here"
```

## Configuration

### Getting Your NUWorks Cookie

1. Log into NUWorks in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Refresh the page
5. Find any request to `northeastern-csm.symplicity.com`
6. Copy the entire `Cookie` header value
7. Add it to your `.env` file

### Customizing Your Profile

Edit the `_build_user_context()` method in [`fetchOpenAi.py`](fetchOpenAi.py) to match your:
- Academic year and major
- GPA and coursework
- Technical skills
- Work experience
- Career interests

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The tool will:
1. Fetch jobs from NUWorks API
2. Save raw data to `response.json`
3. Score each job using OpenAI
4. Filter jobs with scores â‰¥ 50
5. Save filtered results to `goodJobs.json`
6. Generate clickable URLs for each qualifying job

## Output Files

- **`response.json`**: Raw job data from NUWorks API
- **`goodJobs.json`**: Filtered jobs with scores and direct URLs
- **`job_scraper.log`**: Detailed execution logs

## Scoring System

Jobs are scored 0-100 based on:
- **0**: Not qualified for the position
- **25**: Qualified but not in area of interest
- **50**: Qualified and somewhat relevant
- **100**: Perfect match - qualified and highly relevant

## Job Search Parameters

The tool searches for co-ops in these industries:
- Finance and Banking
- Technology and Software
- Consulting
- Data Science and Analytics

Default filters:
- Job type: Co-op (5)
- Posted within: Last 7 days
- Results per page: 100

## Customization

### Changing Score Threshold
Modify the `min_score` parameter in `main.py`:
```python
good_jobs = scraper.process_jobs(jobs_data, min_score=75)  # Higher threshold
```

### Adjusting Search Filters
Edit the `params` dictionary in the `JobScraper` class to modify:
- Industries
- Job types
- Date ranges
- Result limits

### Modifying AI Scoring
Update the system prompt in `_build_system_prompt()` to change how jobs are evaluated.
